# miniHackathon


This is actually prepared for minihackathon conductedd by WIT.
our project was based on opencv python. No one in our team were not aware of opencv, even about python.

We had an idea to create website where we can upload a file which consists of images, texts and links. It will provide the users to extract and download images, texts to copy and links to visit.
Unfortunately, our system didn't support some libraries.

So, we switch into another idea of website which is capable of showing our face landmarks in livestreaming. Badly, windows didn't support the library mediapipe.
Despite all these pullbacks, we didn't step backforth and decided to build atleast a live streaming codes in opencv python. It works.

But, before linking our website to python file our time up.
